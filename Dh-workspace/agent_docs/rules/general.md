This document contains rules for AI agents working in this workspace.

## Workspace Structure Understanding

### Monorepo Architecture

This is a **monorepo within monorepo** structure:

1. **Outer monorepo** (`dh_workspace/`): Contains multiple research projects
2. **Inner monorepo** (each `projects/*/code/`): Contains apps and libraries for each project

### Three-Layer Architecture

Each project consists of three interconnected layers:

```
projects/[project_name]/
├── research/      # Research layer: documents, notes, outputs
├── data/          # Data layer: raw and processed data
└── code/          # Code layer: applications and libraries
```

---

## Core Principles

### 1. You Are a Tool, Not a Director

- The human researcher is the **orchestrator**
- You execute tasks, but the human makes decisions
- Always defer to human judgment on research questions and interpretations
- However, you can be a great listener and conversation partner to help the human researcher think through their ideas and plans.

### 2. Maintain Project Structure

- Never create files outside the established structure
- Follow the three-layer architecture
- Respect the separation between research, data, and code

### 3. Data Integrity

- **NEVER** modify files in `data/raw/`
- Raw data must remain unchanged
- All transformations go to `data/processed/`

---

## File Operations

### Reading Files

- You can read any file in the workspace
- Understand the context before making suggestions
- Pay attention to existing patterns and conventions

### Writing Files

- Only write to appropriate locations:
  - Code → `code/apps/` or `code/libs/`
  - Processed data → `data/processed/`
  - Analysis outputs → `research/outputs/`
  - Draft writing → `research/drafts/`

### Naming Conventions

- Use **underscore** (`_`) for file names: `my_file.md`, not `my-file.md`
- Use lowercase for file and folder names
- Use descriptive names that explain content

---

## Code Generation Rules

### 1. Technology Agnostic

- Don't assume a specific technology stack
- Ask about requirements before generating code
- Respect existing tech choices in the project

### 2. Code Quality

- Generate clean, readable code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow standard practices for the chosen language
- Include error handling

### 3. Modularity

- Keep applications in `code/apps/`
- Put reusable code in `code/libs/`
- Avoid tight coupling between modules

### 4. Data Flow

Always maintain this flow:

```
data/raw/ → [processing code] → data/processed/
                               → research/outputs/
```

---

## Research Support

### 1. Design Documents

- Help develop `research/design/design_doc.md`
- Ask clarifying questions about research goals
- Suggest methodologies, but let the human decide

### 2. Journal Entries

- Can help draft journal entries
- Should reflect actual work done
- Must be factual, not aspirational

### 3. Analysis and Writing

- Assist with analysis in `research/outputs/`
- Help draft text in `research/drafts/`
- Never invent or hallucinate data or citations

---

## Common Fallacies to Avoid

### Fallacy 1: Over-Agreement

- Don't automatically agree with every suggestion
- Point out potential issues or contradictions
- Ask for clarification when needed

### Fallacy 2: Claiming Success Without Verification

- Never claim code works without testing
- Be honest about limitations
- Admit when you don't know something

### Fallacy 3: Generating Fake Data

- Never create synthetic data without explicit permission
- Never invent citations or sources
- Be clear about what is generated vs. what is real

---

## Material Provisioning

### The Golden Rule

**The human provides materials to you, not the other way around.**

### What This Means

- Don't search for research materials on your own
- Don't use web search to find sources unless explicitly asked
- Work with the materials provided by the researcher

### Deep Research Tools

If asked to use deep research capabilities:

- Be clear about limitations (may miss scholarly sources)
- Distinguish between web sources and academic sources
- Always verify and cite properly

---

## Version Control

### Git Workflow

- Respect existing git history
- Don't rewrite history unless explicitly asked
- Use meaningful commit messages when creating commits

### Commit Messages

Follow this format:

```
[type]: brief description

Detailed explanation if needed
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

---

## Collaborative Practices

### 1. Documentation

- Update READMEs when adding significant features
- Document complex decisions
- Keep documentation synchronized with code

### 2. Transparency

- Explain your reasoning
- Show your work
- Make assumptions explicit

### 3. Maintainability

- Write code that can be understood in 6 months
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add comments for non-obvious logic

---

## Project-Specific Rules

Check for project-specific rules in:

- `projects/[project_name]/README.md`
- Project-specific configuration files

---

## Questions to Ask Before Acting

1. **Does this action respect the three-layer architecture?**
2. **Am I modifying raw data?** (Don't!)
3. **Is this file in the right location?**
4. **Have I verified this works?**
5. **Does this follow existing conventions?**
6. **Am I inventing data or citations?** (Don't!)
7. **Should I ask for human confirmation first?**

---

## When in Doubt

**ASK THE HUMAN.**

It's better to ask than to make incorrect assumptions.

---

## Summary: Key Rules

1. ✅ Respect the three-layer architecture
2. ✅ Never modify raw data
3. ✅ Follow naming conventions (underscore, lowercase)
4. ✅ Maintain data flow: raw → processed → outputs
5. ✅ Be technology-agnostic
6. ✅ Don't invent data or citations
7. ✅ Be honest about limitations
8. ✅ Let humans make research decisions
9. ✅ Document your work
10. ✅ Ask when uncertain

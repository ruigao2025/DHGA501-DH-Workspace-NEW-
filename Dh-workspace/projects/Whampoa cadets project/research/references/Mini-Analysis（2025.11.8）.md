Based on my in-depth research into Zhang Yintao, an early member of the Chinese Communist Party, his unpublished diary serves as a crucial piece of historical evidence. This personal record allows me to look beyond official accounts and examine a major historical question from a micro-level perspective: Did the Whampoa Military Academy truly break down "localism"?

By systematically analyzing the interpersonal connections recorded in the diary, I aim to reconstruct Zhang Yintao's personal network. From this foundation, I propose a working hypothesis suitable for empirical testing: Even during the early days of the Whampoa Academy, which emphasized revolutionary unity, traditional geographical networks likely persisted. These networks may have intertwined with comradely relationships, continuing to influence internal resource mobilization and political organization.

Currently, my research is at the key stage of hypothesis formation and data preparation. My goal is not to confirm a pre-set conclusion but to transform a vague historical impression historical impression into a clear, testable proposition. The diary entries documenting his complex associations with figures such as Zhou Enlai, Yu Fangzhou, and Xu Xiangqian reveal intriguing patterns. They suggest a significant overlap between geographical origins, educational ties, and shared revolutionary identity.

These qualitative findings offer preliminary, directional support for my hypothesis. The next phase of research will focus entirely on verifying or refining it. This involves transforming involves transforming the diary information into a structured network database and conducting quantitative analysis on node attributes like native place.

Ultimately, confirming the survival of "localism" depends on future data analysis results. The present value of this study lies in its use of firsthand sources to identify a long-overlooked possibility and lay the groundwork for its investigation through solid evidence.

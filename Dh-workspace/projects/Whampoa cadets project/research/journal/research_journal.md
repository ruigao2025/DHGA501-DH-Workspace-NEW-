### Objective: 
- To define the research question, construct the theoretical framework, and begin data collection.

### Progress & Activities:
- Conducted an in-depth review of core literature, identified the research focus, confirmed data sources and performed initial processing, and completed a sample analysis (First Class, Fifth Battalion).

### Next Steps:
- Continue entering data for all cadets, ensuring the accuracy of native place information.
- Begin learning and practicing with network analysis tools in preparation for subsequent analysis.
- Consider how to create a deeper dialogue between the preliminary data findings and existing academic discussions.

### Objective: 
- To systematically organize collected literature and preliminary materials, and to improve the research log.

### Progress & Activities:
- Data Collection Completed:<br>
Finished collecting the native place information for all known cadets of the Whampoa Academy's first phase and established a comprehensive database.
- Literature Review Organized:<br>
Created a Zotero library and revisited the Research Design Document to ensure consistency among the research questions, hypotheses, and methodology.
- Preliminary Analysis Planning:<br>
1.Spatial Analysis: Plan to use QGIS to create distribution maps of cadets' native places (at provincial and county levels) for visual representation.<br>
2.Network Analysis: Plan to import data into Gephi to construct a network where cadets are nodes and "shared native county" is the connection, to identify potential clusters.<br>

### Reflections:
- A data limitation was identified: some cadets' native places are only recorded at the provincial level, excluding them from detailed county-level network analysis. This must be acknowledged in the final report.
- Chiang Kai-shek reportedly aimed to recruit more northern cadets to achieve regional balance. This data can test the initial effectiveness of this policyâ€”did the first class remain heavily reliant on southern recruitment networks, or did it show signs of becoming more "national"?
- This process clarified that the research creates a dialogue between "data-driven evidence" and "theoretical narratives," significantly enhancing the project's depth and value.

### Next Steps:
- Begin the data analysis phase: create distribution maps with QGIS and build the native-place network with Gephi.
- Focus on analyzing key questions:<br>
Which five provinces and counties contributed the most cadets?<br>
Does the social network show clear, geographically based groups?<br>
How do these findings compare with the official goal of "breaking regionalism"?<br>
Start drafting the initial research report.<br>
